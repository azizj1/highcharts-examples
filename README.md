# Highcharts Examples for Lean UX Customer Visits
A customer visit for us consists of taking a high-fidelity prototype out to our customers, asking them to do a few workflows on the mockup, and then observing the usability of said mockup. 

After the observations, we interview them, probing for any features they'd like to see. Lastly, we debrief on our visit and mockup. We recite several statements, and ask them to rate it from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

When returning back to campus, stakeholders urgently want a summary of the findings. The charts below have helped summarize those results.
